## Education

### **University at Buffalo** `2018.9 -`

```
Buffalo, NY
```

- M.S. in Computer Science

## Software Engineering projects

### **Map Application with Google Map API /Java** `Summer 2019`
- Developed a map application similar to Google Map to provide and visualize routes using real- world geographic data.
- Graph search algorithms including **BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A*** Search are incorporated.

### **Map Overlay for Google Map /Java** `Summer 2019`
- Developed a powerful interactive map application with Unfolding Maps package to visualize large dataset tagged with geospatial information, which includes real-time data about earthquakes happened around the world and the data of life expectancy from the World Bank.

### **Smart Text Editor /Java** `Summer 2019`
- Built a smart text editor/processor that incorporates intelligent behaviors of modern-day text
interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling suggestion.
- Implemented intelligent modules including readability analysis of text, text auto-generation
and finding word path from one word to another, which are used in NLP.

### **Dynamo-style Distributed Storage System /Java, Android** `Spring 2019`
- Developed a group messenger application in Android that simulates client-server communication using the Socket API and enables multicast messages among several AVDs.
- Designed a simple DHT based on Chord and implemented an Amazon Dynamo-style key-value storage system with the functionalities of partitioning, quorum replication and failure handling.

## Blockchain Application project

### **Dapp(Decentralized Application) for voting system** `Autumn 2019`

## DataMining projects

### **Implemented PAC and Apriori and association rule generation algorithms** `Autumn 2019`
- implement PCA(Principle Components Analysis) algorithm from scratch, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points
- Implemented Apriori and association rule generation algorithms from scratch

### **Clustering algorithms** `Autumn 2019`
- Implement five clustering algorithms(**K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Min approach, density-based, mixture model, and spectral clustering**) to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles
- Using external index (Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient) and compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms.
- Visualize data sets and clustering results by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### **Classification Algorithms** `Autumn 2019`
- Implement three classification algorithms: **Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes**, and implement **Random Forests** based on implementation of Decision Tree.
- Adopt 10-fold **Cross Validation** to evaluate the performance of all methods on the datasets in terms of **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure**.

## Experience

### **Carnegie Mellon University, Research Experiences for Undergraduate** `2017.5 - 2017.8`

_Research Assistant_<br>
**Penrose** is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics using two domain-specific languages: **Substance** and **Style**. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.

### **Columbia University, Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab** `2017.1 - 2017.5`

_Research Assistant_<br>
Worked with prof. Steven Feiner, on **Cyber Affordance Visualization in Augumented Reality** project. Developed a Microsoft Hololens application that visualizes the Columbia campus in AR environment.

### **AsiaInfo** `2015.6 - 2015.8`

_Software Engineering Intern_<br>
Worked on server-side web applications and server deployment tools.
